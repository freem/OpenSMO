Open-source Stepmania Online server written in Mono C#.

================================================================================
[Prerequisites]
* IronPython (v2.7.0.40 or greater)
	http://ironpython.codeplex.com/

* MySQL Connector/Net (if using MySQL support)
	https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net

================================================================================
[Building]
Ensure that the prerequisites are installed properly. Setup of the prerequisites
might differ per platform. Typically, installers can be found for Windows, while
those on Linux, BSD, OS X, and other operating systems will need to add the DLLs
to their Mono collection.

<Windows>
Use StepServer.sln to build (via Visual C#, MSBuild, or what have you).

(via MSBuild)
0) Ensure that msbuild works by trying to run it from the command line by itself.
If it does not work, you might need to use the Visual Studio Command Prompt.

1) Once you have verified that msbuild is a valid command, go to the src folder
and run "msbuild StepServer.sln" (without quotes; press enter... wait for the
build process to happen).

By default, msbuild builds only the Debug project. In order to build the
Release project, you'll need to run "msbuild /p:Configuration=Release" instead.

(via Visual Studio)
1) Open src/StepServer.sln.
2) Perform a build; Building makes both Debug and Release binaries.

<Mono>
1) Ensure IronPython is installed properly. A guide is available here:
http://crowdtheory.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/getting-infer-net-and-ironpython-to-work-on-ubuntu-12-04/
(You can ignore the parts about Infer.NET, as OpenSMO does not use it.)

The IronPython-related DLLs you will need to copy into your Mono collection are:
* IronPython.dll
* IronPython.Modules.dll
* Microsoft.Scripting.dll

2) Ensure the MySQL Connector/Net DLL (MySql.Data.dll) is installed.

3) Once you've confirmed that these DLLs are installed, you can compile with
xbuild. By default, xbuild builds only the Debug project. In order to build the
Release project, you'll need to run "xbuild /p:Configuration=Release" instead.

================================================================================
[Scripting]
OpenSMO uses IronPython for scripting. OpenSMO also expects there to be a Scripts
subdirectory where the OpenSMO.exe lives, with a file called "_Main.py".
