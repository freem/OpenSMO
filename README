Open-source Stepmania Online server written in Mono C#.

Follow my progress: http://twitter.com/ansjh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Prerequisites]
* IronPython (v2.7.0.40 or greater)
* MySQL Connector/Net (if using MySQL support)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Building]
(Build steps to be verified)

<Windows>
Use StepServer.sln to build (via Visual C#, MSBuild, or what have you).

<Mono>
1) Ensure IronPython is installed properly. A guide is available here:
http://crowdtheory.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/getting-infer-net-and-ironpython-to-work-on-ubuntu-12-04/

The IronPython-related DLLs you will need to copy into your mono collection are:
* IronPython.dll
* IronPython.Modules.dll
* Microsoft.Scripting.dll

2) Ensure the MySQL Connector/Net DLL (MySql.Data.dll) is installed.

3) Once you've confirmed that these DLLs are installed, you can compile with
xbuild. By default, xbuild builds the Debug project. In order to build the
Release project, you'll need to run "xbuild /p:Configuration=Release" instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Configuration]
The server is configured with a file called "Config.ini" in the same folder as
the exectuable. If this file does not exist, the server will not run.

* Server_Name				(string)	Server display name
* Server_HigherPriority		(bool)		Server runs at higher priority if true
* Server_IP					(string)	IP address of the server
* Server_Port				(int)		Port number to run the server on
* Server_MOTD				(string)	Server message of the day
* Server_FPS				(int)		Number of frames per second
* Server_Offset				(int)		(??)
* Server_Version			(int)		(??)
* Server_MaxPlayers			(int)		Maximum number of players on the server
* Allow_Registration		(bool)		Allow registrations on server if true

(SQLite-related Settings)
* Database_UseCommit		(bool)		Performs commits if true?
* Database_CommitTime		(int)		Amount of time to wait for a database commit?

* MySql_Host				(string)	Hostname for MySQL server
* MySql_User				(string)	Username for MySQL server
* MySql_Password			(string)	Password for user on MySQL server
* MySql_Database			(string)	Database name on MySQL server
* MySql_Timeout				(string)	Default command timeout

(RTS-related Settings)
* RTS_Enabled				(bool)		(??)
* RTS_IP					(string)	(??)

* RTS_Trusted				(???)		(??)

(Others)
* Game_ShadowBan			(bool)		(??)

(Unused)

===(Example 'working' Config.ini)===
Server_Name=freemzone
Server_HigherPriority=false
Server_FPS=60
Server_IP=127.0.0.1
Server_Port=32768
RTS_Enabled=false

[Scripting]
OpenSMO uses IronPython for scripting. OpenSMO also expects there to be a Scripts
subdirectory where the OpenSMO.exe lives, with a file called "_Main.py".
