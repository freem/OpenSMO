Open-source Stepmania Online server written in Mono C#.

================================================================================
[Prerequisites]
* IronPython (v2.7.0.40 or greater)
* MySQL Connector/Net (if using MySQL support)

================================================================================
[Building]
(Build steps to be verified)

<Windows>
Use StepServer.sln to build (via Visual C#, MSBuild, or what have you).

<Mono>
1) Ensure IronPython is installed properly. A guide is available here:
http://crowdtheory.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/getting-infer-net-and-ironpython-to-work-on-ubuntu-12-04/

The IronPython-related DLLs you will need to copy into your mono collection are:
* IronPython.dll
* IronPython.Modules.dll
* Microsoft.Scripting.dll

2) Ensure the MySQL Connector/Net DLL (MySql.Data.dll) is installed.

3) Once you've confirmed that these DLLs are installed, you can compile with
xbuild. By default, xbuild builds the Debug project. In order to build the
Release project, you'll need to run "xbuild /p:Configuration=Release" instead.

================================================================================
[Scripting]
OpenSMO uses IronPython for scripting. OpenSMO also expects there to be a Scripts
subdirectory where the OpenSMO.exe lives, with a file called "_Main.py".
