freem's personal TODO list:
* Change scripting from Python to Lua (if possible)

* Find out differences between forks
[differs between mainline and OpenSMO_smo.net]
Data.cs
Main.cs
(MySQL doesn't exist in OpenSMO_smo.net)
User.cs

[differs between mainline and OpenSMO_SandonV]
AssemblyInfo.cs
Config.cs
Data.cs
Ez.cs
probably everything...
